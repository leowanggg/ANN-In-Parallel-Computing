This is the archives of my PFE(projet de fin d'etude).In this project,
I realize an Artificial Neural Network which can recognize two different 
gestures in C++. Then I parallelize this program by library OpenMP to improve 
the performance.

There are two sub-directories in this directory, one is named "source" which
contains all the source codes of this project. The other one named "document"
includes my rapport and the PPT file for presentation.

if you want the program executes correctly, you need to have the database of the
the gestures, and to set the path of you directory of the database at line 92 in 
the pre-training.cpp file.
